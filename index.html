     <h1 id="rules-for-structuring-papers">Rules for Structuring Papers</h1>

<p>When a paper is written and read, everyone involved has their own motivation and priority.
Authors want their important contributions to reach the broadest audience possible.
Editors want the paper to be signficant.
Reviewers want to quickly understand whether the contributions are validated by the results.
Readers want to quickly undertand the conceptual conceptions before going through it in depth.</p>

<p>A successful paper communicates the relationship between data, methods, and interpretations.
The interpretations culminate in a <strong>claim</strong> that gives significance to the work.
This claim has to be supported by data and logic that gives it credibility.
The paper&rsquo;s logic should be carefully planned such that there are logical steps to reach the conclusion.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ol>
<li>Present only One central contribution per paper, which is communicated in the title.</li>
<li>Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know about the work.</li>
<li>Stick to the Context-Content-Conclustion (CCC) scheme.
Title and abstract reveals content quickly to the impatient reader.
A patient reader will spend time in understanding the context.
For the whole paper,
    1. Introduction sets the context.<br>
    2. Results are the content.
    3. Discussion is the conclution</li>
<li>Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism
Avoiding Zig-Zag: Related sentences, or related paragraphs should be strung together.
Using Parallelism: Across consecutive paragrams or sentences, use similar structure to help the reader focus on the content.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-components-of-a-papers">The components of a papers</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Tell a complete story in the abstract.</p>

<p>The one question is (context)</p>

<p>Here we do (content)</p>

<p>What we found (content)</p>

<p>How it matters (conclusion)</p></li>

<li><p>Get across why the paper matters in the introduction.
Big problem in science     | -&gt; Field domain</p>

<p>Narrower Problem Within    |    what field knows</p>

<p>Yet narrower paper Gap     |    remaining gap</p>

<p>Summary                    -&gt; Our Approach and Our Results</p></li>

<li><p>Communicate the results as a sequence of statements that build on one another to support the central contribution.
Methods Summary</p>

<p>Logic 1 (e.g. Raw Data)         | -&gt; To answer our questions, General methods</p>

<p>Logic 2 (e.g. Processed)        | Figures tell whole story</p>

<p>Logic n (e.g. final statistics) | -&gt; The current question, How we asked it, The answer</p></li>

<li><p>Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretations, and relevance to the field.
Results -&gt; Conclusion           | we found, we filled a gap</p>

<p>Limitations in filling gap      | -&gt; Limitations, Details</p>

<p>Limits in generalization        | How to interpret / fix</p>

<p>Contributions beyond            | -&gt; Strength, What it is useful for</p>

<p>Science is better now           | The difference made</p></li>

<li><p>Allocate time where it matters: Title, abstract, figures, and outlining.</p></li>

<li><p>Get feedback to reduce, reuse and recycle the story.</p></li>

<h2 id="natural-language">Natural Language</h2>

<p>A system of communication that evolves naturally through use, repetition and
change without conscious planning or premeditation. Each language has its own
structure that can be learned.</p>

<p>Syntax are the rules for composing language. Semantics is for understanding the
meaning of the composed language.</p>
