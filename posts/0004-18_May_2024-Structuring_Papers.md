Rules for Structuring Papers
============================

When a paper is written and read, everyone involved has their own motivation and priority.
Authors want their important contributions to reach the broadest audience possible.
Editors want the paper to be signficant.
Reviewers want to quickly understand whether the contributions are validated by the results.
Readers want to quickly undertand the conceptual conceptions before going through it in depth.

A successful paper communicates the relationship between data, methods, and interpretations.
The interpretations culminate in a __claim__ that gives significance to the work.
This claim has to be supported by data and logic that gives it credibility.
The paper's logic should be carefully planned such that there are logical steps to reach the conclusion.

Principles
----------

1. Present only One central contribution per paper, which is communicated in the title.
2. Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know about the work.
3. Stick to the Context-Content-Conclustion (CCC) scheme.
    Title and abstract reveals content quickly to the impatient reader.
    A patient reader will spend time in understanding the context.
    For the whole paper,
        1. Introduction sets the context.   
        2. Results are the content.
        3. Discussion is the conclution
4. Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism
    Avoiding Zig-Zag: Related sentences, or related paragraphs should be strung together.
    Using Parallelism: Across consecutive paragrams or sentences, use similar structure to help the reader focus on the content.

The components of a papers
--------------------------

5. Tell a complete story in the abstract.

    The one question is (context)

    Here we do (content)

    What we found (content)

    How it matters (conclusion)
6. Get across why the paper matters in the introduction.
    Big problem in science     | -> Field domain

    Narrower Problem Within    |    what field knows 

    Yet narrower paper Gap     |    remaining gap 

    Summary                    -> Our Approach and Our Results

7. Communicate the results as a sequence of statements that build on one another to support the central contribution.
    Methods Summary

    Logic 1 (e.g. Raw Data)         | -> To answer our questions, General methods

    Logic 2 (e.g. Processed)        | Figures tell whole story

    Logic n (e.g. final statistics) | -> The current question, How we asked it, The answer

8. Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretations, and relevance to the field.
    Results -> Conclusion           | we found, we filled a gap

    Limitations in filling gap      | -> Limitations, Details

    Limits in generalization        | How to interpret / fix

    Contributions beyond            | -> Strength, What it is useful for

    Science is better now           | The difference made


9. Allocate time where it matters: Title, abstract, figures, and outlining.
10. Get feedback to reduce, reuse and recycle the story.
