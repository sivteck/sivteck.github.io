Rules for Reading Papers
========================

1. Pick Your Reading Goal
2. Understand the Author's Goal
3. Ask Six Questions
    1. What do the authors want to know? (motivation)
    2. What did they do? (approach/methods)
    3. Why was it done that way? (context within the field)
    4. What do the results show? (figures and data tables)
    5. How did the authors interpret the results? (interpretation/discussion)
    6. What should be done next? 
4. Unpack each figure and table
5. Understand the formatting intentions
6. Be critical
7. Be kind (when sharing critique, give authors, benefit of the doubt)
8. Be ready to go the extra mile (Recommended to read three times, look up terms, read supplemental materials and read one or two cited papers)
9. Talk about it
10. Build on it.
